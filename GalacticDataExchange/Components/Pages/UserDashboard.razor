						Xel'Vorr, a senior data curator from the Zeta Reticuli system, has served the Galactic Council of Archives for over 4,000 Earth years.
						Born into the crystalline academies of Reticulum Prime, he quickly advanced through quantum information disciplines, eventually leading
						interstellar initiatives in secure data transfer, anti-corruption indexing, and multi-species metadata normalization.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now stationed at the Galactic Data Exchange, Xel'Vorr oversees the intake and validation of high-priority galactic artifacts and historical transmissions.
						Known for his unmatched memory capacity and calm demeanor, he is a cornerstone of the GDX's credibility across known star systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						When he's not monitoring data flows or decoding ancient hyper-scripts, Xel'Vorr enjoys observing lava lamp thermodynamics,
						curating retro Earth objects, and cataloging unidentified atmospheric phenomena — one of which hangs as a framed photo behind his desk.
